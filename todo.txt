- Export mesh tangents and add normal maps
- Distance field to show wear marks near center of track
- Automatically place decals on track (e.g. patch work, dirt, grunge, tire marks)
- Moving parts on vehicles (e.g. bouncing/swaying antenna)
- Add grass placement system (auto-stick to terrain, overlapping objects automatically destroy it)
- Add support for importing a heightmap into the editor
- Multi-thread certain parts (e.g. physics and particles can be simulated at the same time)
- Add force-feedback for collisions, offroad, etc.
- Change cursor when hovering over something interactable
- Render with pre-multiplied alpha
- Use time dilation for some effect (maybe when last person crosses finish line? A power up?)
- Allow setting the number of laps for a race in the editor (can make a short track with many laps, or a long track with few laps)
- Get rid of GLM because it makes compile times so long
- Add motion blur when using rocket booster
- Add muzzle flash for minigun
- Make minigun bullets look more like bullets (streak instead of glowing orbs)
- Add testing zone where you can drive around an open area
- Add rippling flag
- Add wind motion for plants and trees
- Add powerups? Will have to think about whether this is a good idea game design wise
- Kinetic armor effect
- Create general-purpose particle system
- Make better explosion effect
- Add more cosmetic options (decals)
- Allow vehicles to move before race starts?
- Add armor icon beside healthbar
- Add batching or instancing to improve rendering performance
- Don't blow up so easily when two wheels are off the track
- Add splitscreen configuration (horizontal vs vertical split for two and three players)
- Vibrate player's controller when that player is selected (so that the player can be identified)
- Fix culling on cactus thorns (fix when new material system is implemented)
- Use heightfield for terrain collision geometry
- Add ability to create holes in the terrain (for tunnels, caves, .etc)
- Add sound effect when driving on sand
- Add ability to snap spline to edge of track in editor 
- Improve AI when slipping on oil (counter-steer)
- Undo/Redo in editor
- Add little speed boost right after respawning in order to reduce the penalty for being destroyed
- Audio volume distance falloff should be configured on the audio resource
- Add texture compression
- Add difficulty levels

- Ideas:
    - Grenade launcher weapon
    - Weapon that drops bouncing explosive balls from the back of the vehicle
    - Missile rack on back of truck (shoots high into the air and homes down on a target)
    - Vehicle upgrade with visual properties, like a spoiler for downforce, or visual armour
    - Shield ability
    - Ability that creates huge explosion when vehicle is destoyed, damaging nearby vehicles
    - Deathmatch mode, or a mode where everybody races around a map to pickup an item that spawns randomly
