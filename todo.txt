- Distance field to show wear marks near center of track
- Automatically place decals on track (e.g. patch work, dirt, grunge, tire marks)
- Moving parts on vehicles (e.g. bouncing/swaying antenna)
- Add grass placement system (auto-stick to terrain, overlapping objects automatically destroy it)
- Add support for importing a heightmap into the editor
- Multi-thread certain parts (e.g. physics and particles can be simulated at the same time)
- Add force-feedback for collisions, offroad, etc.
- Render with pre-multiplied alpha
- Use time dilation for some effect (maybe when last person crosses finish line? A power up?)
- Get rid of GLM because it makes compile times so long
- Add motion blur when using rocket booster
- Add muzzle flash for minigun
- Make minigun bullets look more like bullets (streak instead of glowing orbs)
- Add testing zone where you can drive around an open area
- Add rippling flag
- Add powerups? Will have to think about whether this is a good idea game design wise
- Kinetic armor effect
- Create general-purpose particle system
- Make better explosion effect
- Add more cosmetic options (decals)
- Allow vehicles to move before race starts?
- Add armor icon beside healthbar
- Add batching or instancing to improve rendering performance
- Don't blow up so easily when two wheels are off the track
- Add splitscreen configuration (horizontal vs vertical split for two and three players)
- Vibrate player's controller when that player is selected (so that the player can be identified)
- Use heightfield for terrain collision geometry
- Add ability to create holes in the terrain (for tunnels, caves, .etc)
- Add sound effect when driving on sand
- Add ability to snap spline to edge of track in editor 
- Improve AI when slipping on oil (counter-steer)
- Undo/Redo in editor
- Add texture compression
- Add difficulty levels
- Add passive ability that gives a bit of ammo when destroyed
- Fix stutter when race starts or hide it with black screen that fades out
- Shoot out shell casings when minigun is fired
- Fix transform gizmo
- Vehicle respawn angles are awkward sometimes
- Glue should probably slow vehicles down more
- Compile in release mode with -ffastmath
- Fix depth issues with rumblestrip

- Ideas:
    - Grenade launcher weapon
    - Weapon that drops bouncing explosive balls from the back of the vehicle
    - Missile rack on back of truck (shoots high into the air and homes down on a target)
    - Vehicle upgrade with visual properties, like a spoiler for downforce, or visual armour
    - Shield ability
    - Ability that creates huge explosion when vehicle is destoyed, damaging nearby vehicles
    - Deathmatch mode, or a mode where everybody races around a map to pickup an item that spawns randomly
