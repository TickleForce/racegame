- Export mesh tangents and add normal maps
- Automatically place decals on track (e.g. patch work, dirt, grunge, tire marks)
- Moving parts on vehicles (e.g. bouncing/swaying antenna)
- Add grass placement system (auto-stick to terrain, overlapping objects automatically destroy it)
- Add support for importing a heightmap into the editor
- Multi-thread certain parts (e.g. physics and particles can be simulated at the same time)
- Add force-feedback for collisions, offroad, etc.
- Change cursor when hovering over something interactable
- Render with pre-multiplied alpha
- Use time dilation for some effect (maybe when last person crosses finish line?)
- Add unlit mode for bright billboards
- Implement lapping bonus
- Show final lap indicator
- Allow setting the number of laps for a race in the editor
- Add collectables on the track

- Ideas:
    - Weapon that drops bouncing explosive balls from the back of the vehicle
    - Missle rack on back of truck
    - Weapon that shoots projectiles that bounce off walls and continue on
    - Vehicle upgrade with visual properties, like a spoiler for downforce, or visual armour
