- Export mesh tangents and add normal maps
- Automatically place decals on track (e.g. patch work, dirt, grunge, tire marks)
- Moving parts on vehicles (e.g. bouncing/swaying antenna)
- Add grass placement system (auto-stick to terrain, overlapping objects automatically destroy it)
- Add support for importing a heightmap into the editor
- Multi-thread certain parts (e.g. physics and particles can be simulated at the same time)
- Add force-feedback for collisions, offroad, etc.
- Change cursor when hovering over something interactable
- Render with pre-multiplied alpha
- Use time dilation for some effect (maybe when last person crosses finish line?)
- Allow setting the number of laps for a race in the editor
- Get rid of GLM because it makes compile times so long
- Add motion blur when using rocket booster
- Add muzzle flash for minigun
- Add testing zone where you can drive around an open area
- Add rippling flag
- Add wind motion for plants and trees
- Add air time bonus for being in the air a long time
- Add armor pickup
- Add powerups? Will have to think about whether this is a good idea game design wise

- Ideas:
    - Grenade launcher weapon
    - Weapon that drops bouncing explosive balls from the back of the vehicle
    - Missile rack on back of truck (shoots high into the air and homes down on a target)
    - Vehicle upgrade with visual properties, like a spoiler for downforce, or visual armour
