- Distance field to show wear marks near center of track
- Automatically place decals on track (e.g. patch work, dirt, grunge, tire marks)
- Moving parts on vehicles (e.g. bouncing/swaying antenna)
- Add grass placement system (auto-stick to terrain, overlapping objects automatically destroy it)
- Add support for importing a heightmap into the editor
- Multi-thread certain parts (e.g. physics and particles can be simulated at the same time)
- Multi-thread asset loading
- Add force-feedback for collisions, offroad, etc.
- Render with pre-multiplied alpha
- Use time dilation for some effect (maybe when last person crosses finish line? A power up?)
- Add muzzle flash for minigun
- Make minigun bullets look more like bullets (streak instead of glowing orbs)
- Add testing zone where you can drive around an open area
- Add rippling flag
- Add powerups? Will have to think about whether this is a good idea game design wise
- Create particle system editor
- Make better explosion effect
- Add armor icon beside healthbar
- Don't blow up so easily when two wheels are off the track
- Add splitscreen configuration (horizontal vs vertical split for two and three players)
- Vibrate player's controller when that player is selected (so that the player can be identified)
- Use heightfield for terrain collision geometry
- Add ability to create holes in the terrain (for tunnels, caves, .etc)
- Add ability to pick any 4 materials to paint on terrain
- Add sound effect when driving on sand
- Add ability to snap spline to edge of track in editor 
- Improve AI when slipping on oil (counter-steer)
- Undo/Redo in editor
- Add texture compression (stb_dxt.h) DXT1 for no alpha, DXT3 with alpha 
- Don't store alpha channel for textures that don't need it (24-bit textures)
- Add difficulty levels
- Add passive ability that gives a bit of ammo when destroyed
- Fix stutter when race starts or hide it with black screen that fades out
- Shoot out shell casings when minigun is fired
- Fix transform gizmo (or use https://github.com/CedricGuillemet/ImGuizmo)
- Glue should probably slow vehicles down more
- Compile in release mode with -ffastmath
- Support multiple keyboards (not supported by SDL)
- Show controller button icons on UI buttons when a controller is plugged in
- Show version or git hash in the corner in the menu
- Add challenges mode where you have to do crazy things to complete the challenge, for example
  (beat a lap time, destroy n number of cars with a time limit). These challenges would be unlocked
  as you complete leagues in championship mode.
- Add water
- Think of a name for the game (Battlemobiles?)
- Add vehicle reflection on the floor of garage
- Add suicide ability that creates a massive explosion
- Leave scorch mark on track after explosion
- Add leagues and transitions between leagues
- Batch static decals (they are regular meshes now so there's no reason not to)
- Add tabs to the debug info window (or group information under collapsing headers)
- It should be possible to create a good path offset by checking if the offset point is to close
  to the line in the surrounding area (check forward a bit and also backward a bit). If it is too
  close then use the last known good point. If there is no last point, then loop until one is found.
- Show weapon icon beside attack bonus notice
- Indicate places on the track, in the editor, where the AI should place mines, oil, and glue
- Background music
- Focus the equipped item first in the weapon menu
- Add a mine that has a large explosive force that sends vehicles flying, but does little damage
- Change that horrible collision sound
- Test with Steam controller
- Make AI respect racing line speed
- Should be able to build after a fresh git clone with only a C++ compiler and nothing else.
  This means storing all libraries in the git repo and removing dependency on CMake and Python.
- Add effects for armor and money pickups.
- Experiment with an initial burst at the beginning of a rocket boost, to make it feel better to use.
- Grenade launcher weapon
- Weapon that drops bouncing explosive balls from the back of the vehicle
- Missile rack on back of truck (shoots high into the air and homes down on a target)
- Vehicle upgrade with visual properties, like a spoiler for downforce, or visual armour
- Shield ability
- Ability that creates huge explosion when vehicle is destoyed, damaging nearby vehicles
- Deathmatch mode, or a mode where everybody races around a map to pickup an item that spawns randomly
- Ability that gives immediate burst of speed and big bonus to ramming damage
- Shock wave ability
- Add weapon that deals damage based on race placement (i.e. the driver in first place would receive the most damage)
- Add inverse of jump jet, an ability that slams you to the ground.
- Maybe splines should store their snapped-to-terrain-or-track position, so that it doesn't change when the terrain or track changes.
- Fix hidden view effect on non-nvidia cards
- Add ability to mark any entity as something that can be driven on
- Add a bonus for conserving ammo? If you don't use all your ammo for a lap then give a bonus, or maybe
  this could be a special ability.
- Show waveform visualization in sound window
- Add test area to compare speed of all vehicles in a drag race
- AI should use their weapons more aggressively close to the end of the lap if they still have ammo
- Get bonus money for making it to the next league
- Implement drag & drop throughout the editor (e.g. to drag a material from resource browser into a material slot)
